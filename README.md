# Project-320
77.2 MW Bundled Wind Projects in AP, MP and Maharashtra, India
__________________
The project activity is a large scale bundle (UNFCCC ACM0002 methodology) of 3 wind projects in AP, MP and Maharashtra, India. In the absence of the project activity, electricity would have been delivered to the grid by the operation of fossil fuel-based grid-connected power plants and by the addition of new fossil fuel-based generation sources in the grid. As is the nature of wind projects (renewable energy), no fossil fuel is involved for power generation in the project activity. SDGs 7,8,13
